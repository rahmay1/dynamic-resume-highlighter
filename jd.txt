The Opportunity

We are looking for a motivated and curious Full Stack Development Intern to join our engineering team. This is not a "get coffee" internshipâ€”you will be working on real projects, writing production code, and contributing to features that our customers use. You will be paired with a dedicated mentor to guide you through your journey and help you grow your skills.

What You'll Do:

Assist in the development and maintenance of our web applications across the entire stack (front-end and back-end).

Build responsive and interactive user interfaces using modern frameworks.

Develop and integrate RESTful APIs and backend services.

Write clean, maintainable, and well-tested code.

Participate in code reviews and team meetings to discuss solutions and best practices.

Collaborate with product managers, designers, and other developers in an agile environment.

Learn about software development life cycle, from conception to deployment.

We're Looking For Someone With:

Currently pursuing or recently completed a degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or a related field.

Basic understanding of front-end technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+).

Familiarity with at least one modern front-end framework like React, Vue.js, or Angular.

Basic understanding of back-end development concepts and a willingness to learn frameworks like Node.js/Express, Python/Django, or Java/Spring.

Knowledge of databases (SQL like PostgreSQL/MySQL or NoSQL like MongoDB).

Understanding of Git and version control.

A strong passion for learning new technologies and solving problems.

Good communication skills and a collaborative mindset.

Ability to read and write technical documentation in English.
